tinymce image upload plugin that i was using with a webmail app

its not very general though, so you can't just drop this in your own project and except it to work

though its pretty easy to see what you would need to change to get it to work

this is more an example than anything else


anyway the URL to the server upload processing script is in the <FORM> tag in dialog.htm, and the server should return JSON in the shape of {path: "url_to_uploaded_image.jpg"}
